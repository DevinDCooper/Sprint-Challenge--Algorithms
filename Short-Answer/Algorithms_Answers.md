#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(1) constant because no matter how big (n) gets the run time of the function will still be same.


b)0(n log n) because we pass through first loop n times  and the second is log n because of the J is getting doubled with each loop that is passed.


c) O(n) because we check if bunnies is 0 in bunnyEars and hit every bunnies as we pass through the arr.0


## Exercise II


n = number of floors
f = the lvl of floor the egg will break
if floor < f , egg will not break?
if floor >= f, egg breaks

0(n) we check the floor we are on, and then check the if floor is greater or less then the breaking point F so we are going 2 operations.
